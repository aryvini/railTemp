# railtemp

Module to simulate railway temperatures during the day based on weather conditions. 

The code presented here is subjected of a Master Thesis work being developed on [Instituto Politécnico de Bragança - Portugal](http://portal3.ipb.pt/index.php/pt/). The publication with more details is not yet published. The research is based on a previous model developed by Chungnam National University, that can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12541-019-00015-1).  

The purpose of the code is to facilitate the process of simulate/calculate the heat transfer equation varying many parameters such as: location, section profile, physical aspects and more. Therefore this module abstract the process of solving into some easy classes methods. A example of usage is available [here](example/example.ipynb).
